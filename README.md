# Building-and-Deploying-a-Question-Answering-System-with-Hugging-Face

This project is a demonstration of building and deploying a question answering system using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The system is capable of answering questions based on a given context, making it suitable for various applications such as customer support, information retrieval, and chatbots.

## Overview

The project follows a step-by-step approach to develop and deploy the question answering system:

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and organize the data required for training and evaluation. This involves selecting appropriate datasets, cleaning the data, and formatting it for input into the model.

2. **Model Selection**: Choose a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face model hub that is suitable for question answering tasks. Fine-tuning may be performed on the selected model to improve its performance on specific datasets if necessary.

3. **Training**: Train the selected model on the prepared dataset to learn how to answer questions given a context. This involves optimizing the model's parameters using techniques such as gradient descent and backpropagation.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate dataset using metrics such as exact match score, F1 score, and accuracy. This step helps assess the model's ability to accurately answer questions.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. Streamlit allows you to create user-friendly interfaces and making them accessible to end-users through a web browser.
